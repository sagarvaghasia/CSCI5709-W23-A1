## Getting Started

## TOOLS

The taskflow diagrams are created using draw.io[1] tool. Using draw.io[1], created the taskflow diagram using flowchart template in the tool.

Lo-fidelity diagrams are the wireframes which represnts the actual user experience in mockup. This is the simple mockup of the website which is created using balsamiq.cloud[2]. The template of the website wireframe is available on Balsamiq[2] for reference which is used to create the wireframes.

W3C complaint is validated using W3C complaint[8]. 


## Deployment

The react app[4] is deployed on netlify[3]. The code was first hosted on GitLab and then on GitHub and lastly the netlify account was linked with repository from github.At the end, the web application was deployed in few moements and  then if are any changes then netlify automatically build the react application and deploy it 


## Built With

<!--- Provide a list of the frameworks used to build this application, your list should include the name of the framework used, the url where the framework is available for download and what the framework was used for, see the example below --->

* Framework that I used - [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

## Sources Used

According to the requirement of the assignment for creating front-end, I have used the boilerplate code for the basic react app working[4].
The remaining code is developed by referring the documentation and articles from[5],[6],[7].
